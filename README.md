# cooking-with-chicken
Chicken goes with many different flavours
For an Italian meal, you can add tomatoes, capers, garlic, black olives and hot peppers.  The chicken can be served with fresh parsley and basil and parmesan.  It tastes great with a side salad and fresh bread.
For an Asian meal, you can make a sauce using Hoisin sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds and serve it with rice and green beans.
For a Southern style meal, chicken can be deep fried and served with cole slaw.
